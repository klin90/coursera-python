    "The key is this strategy. If you are ahead, you should rush; if you are behind, you should pass.\n",

    "Why? Suppose you are ahead 5-0. If you rush, you will need to lose 5 more times than you win to give your lead up. However, if you pass, you will only need to lose 3 more times than you win to give your lead up. Thus, you should rush, to minimize the odds of your opponent catching you. With the reverse logic, if you are behind 0-5, you should pass, so you only need 3 more wins than losses to take the lead back.\n",
